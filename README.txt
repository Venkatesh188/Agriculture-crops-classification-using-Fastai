Crop Image Classifier
Overview
This code is a simple implementation of a crop image classifier using the fastai library in Python. The classifier is trained on a dataset of agricultural crop images to identify the type of crop present in an image.
Requirements
Python 3.x
fastai library
PIL (Python Imaging Library)
matplotlib
Usage
Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
Specify the directory path where the crop images are stored.
The code will create a DataLoader from the images directory path and train a vision learner using the AlexNet pre-trained model.
The learner is fine-tuned for several iterations to improve the classification accuracy.
The trained model can be used to make predictions on new images.
Example
python
# Specify the directory path where images are stored
images_dir_path = '/path/to/your/images'

# Create a DataLoader from the images directory path
loaders = block.dataloaders(images_dir_path)

# Create a vision learner using the AlexNet pre-trained model
learner = vision_learner(loaders, alexnet, metrics=error_rate)

# Fine-tune the learner for several iterations
learner.fine_tune(num_epochs, base_lr=learning_rate)

# Make a prediction on a new image
prediction, prediction_index, prediction_scores = learner.predict('path/to/new/image.jpg')

Results
The code provides a confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the trained model. The predicted crop type and the corresponding prediction scores are displayed for new images.
Limitations
The code runs only on the local machine and requires manual setup of the environment and dataset.
The classifier's performance depends on the training dataset's quality and diversity.
Future Improvements
Deployment of the classifier as a web service or API for easier access and integration.
Optimization of the model architecture and training process for better accuracy and efficiency.
Expansion of the dataset to include more crop varieties and improve generalization.
